        One way we can look at Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” is through bell hooks’ “Love as the Practice of Freedom”. This piece comes up with the idea of both an “ethic of love” and an “ethic of domination” in relation to progressive movements and political visions. The Wall presents both of these ethics, but focuses on human emotion and isolation. Throughout Pink’s story during the album, he consistently enforces an ethic of domination, only realizing towards the end the need for an ethic of love. Pink’s ethic of domination is his self-imposed isolation represented by the motif of a wall. Pink cuts himself off from the world and his loved ones in an attempt to escape the trauma and pain that comes with life.
        <br><br>Another Brick in the Wall, pt 1 - This song describes Pink’s childhood without a father, and how it placed the first few bricks in his wall. The song starts with the lyrics “Daddy's flown across the ocean, leaving just a memory” indicating his fathers abandonment of Pink (dying in WW2). Additionally Pink blames his father for abandoning him saying “daddy what else did you leave for me?” All of this trauma is revealed to start Pink's wall of isolation with the lyrics “all in all it’s just another brick in the wall” which additionally undermines the seriousness of the trauma, saying it’s “just another brick in the wall”.  
        <br><br>Mother - Mother illustrates Pink’s blame on his own mother for his isolation due to her overprotectiveness. The lyrics “Mamas gonna keep you right here under her wing, she won’t let you fly but she might let you sing” show Pink’s mother’s protectivity, but also restrictions which come along with it. The lyrics “Ooh babe, of course mamas gonna help build the wall” makes us understand that Pink believes his mother encouraged his isolation, despite only trying to keep him safe. This is further emphasized towards the end, and Pink's full blame for his mother is shown with lyrics “Mother did it need to be so high” where Pink convinces himself that the wall is mainly his mom’s fault. 
        <br><br>All of the above songs and more work to show Pink's ethic of domination. Pink cuts off others and blames his own issues on them in an attempt to fix his own emotional issues. hooks in “Love as the Practice of Freedom” writes “Without an ethic of love shaping the direction of our political vision and our radical aspirations, we are often seduced, in one way or the other, into continued allegiance to systems of domination” (1). This is reflected by Pink, who is seduced into blaming others rather than taking responsibility for his own actions because of his wall preventing not only emotions like love, but pushing out the people who love him as well.    
        <br><br>The Trial - Here Pink realizes what his ethic of domination has done, with a whole imaginary trial occurring in his head. The lyrics “The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother, fills me with the urge to defecate” show how Pink is repulsed by his own actions and blame towards his wife and mother. Pink also realizes that he needs to stop his isolation in order to prevent hurting others with the lyrics “I sentence you to be exposed before your peers. Tear down the wall!”     
        <br><br>Outside the wall - This song shows the need for an ethic of love. The lyrics “the ones who really love you, walk up and down outside the wall” show how there are people who care about us and by letting them in our lives we can deal with trauma without cutting off emotion entirely. Hooks writes “Often, then, the longing is not for a collective transformation of society, an end to politics of dominations, but rather simply for an end to what we feel is hurting us. This is why we desperately need an ethic of love to intervene in our self centered longing for change.” Again we see Pink reflecting this, as he uses domination as a way to uplift himself, by blaming his troubles on others, but we can avoid emotional issues entirely if we stop pushing people out of our lives and loving them which can help us tear down our own and others isolating walls.

        By looking at Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” through a psychoanalytic lens, we can answer the question: how does your understanding of the characters, their relationships, their actions, and their motivations in a literary work help you better understand the mental world and imaginative life, or the actions and motivations of the author? Because the album is largely based on Roger’s own experiences, Pink reflects an exaggerated image of how Roger was, and so, we can see these ethics of love and domination from the previous paragraph shown in Roger’s life. The album started during Pink Floyd’s 1977 In The Flesh tour. Roger was overwhelmed by the crowd and ended up spitting on a fan. Afterwards he said he imagined building a wall between himself and the crowd, as a way to isolate himself from the chaos, similar to Pink’s wall which keeps him from the emotional chaos caused by the outside world. Roger also shows this after and during the album was created, with his ego taking over, believing he was the sole musical genius in the band. This caused isolation from the other band members leading to kicking out Richard Wright and other tensions between them. This further emphasizes the need for an ethic of love reflected in real life and not with a fictional character. Roger used an ethic of domination to put him in charge of the band, hurting the other members, inevitably causing issues and the decline of the band. If Roger had used an ethic of love, he could have kept the band where it was in its prime by keeping everyone involved rather than pushing them out.

        The wall serves to break many social myths through the span of the album, commenting on the actuality of education and other subjects impacting Pink’s life. The main social myth broken by the album though is that showing emotion is a form of weakness. This is a very common social myth affecting many people, especially men who feel they must conform to certain standards in order to be ideal for society, one of which being hiding emotions. We can see this social myths affect on Pink various times during the course of the album, mainly during the second half.
        <br><br>Hey You - This song works to show how Pink’s isolation has negatively affected him. The lyrics “Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?” show a cry for help from Pink, who repeatedly says “hey you” throughout the song, asking if other people feel the same way as him in order to feel some connection to others. Lyrics “But it was only fantasy, the wall was too high, as you can see. No matter he tried he could not break free” show how trapped Pink feels behind his isolating wall and how he is too far gone to simply climb over his wall. This song also provides the idea that everyone tries to isolate themselves and build a wall so that their emotions can be hidden from the rest of the world too with the lyrics “Together we stand, divided we fall” despite being physically close to others, we all try to hide ourselves to varying degrees by building walls between ourselves.
        <br><br>Comfortably Numb - This song reveals the dullness of life without emotion, yet it's comforting nature. Lyrics “There is no pain you are receding” show Pink’s inability to feel behind his wall, feeling completely separated from the rest of the world. The chorus “I have become comfortably numb” further emphasizes the “numbness” of living behind a wall, but it also adds the comfort of it, being what Pink wanted in the first place after his childhood trauma.
        <br><br>The Trial - This is the song that shows Pink’s belief of weakness in showing emotion and also helps to destroy the social myth that emotion is weak. During this song, an imaginary trial plays out in Pink’s head. The lyrics “the prisoner who stands before you was caught showing feelings of an almost human nature.” show how Pink criticized himself for showing emotions. Additionally lyrics “since my friend you have revealed your deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers” show how Pinks deepest fear is for his emotions to be revealed to the world and punishing himself by tearing down his own wall.
        <br><br>All these songs help to show the harm in keeping in emotions and cutting them off entirely. We become isolated and cut off from those around us, feeling little connection despite making us comfortable.

      <p id="4" class="text">The Wall was created in 1979 by rock band Pink Floyd, mainly known for their other album, The Dark Side of the Moon. The Wall is both an album and a movie, focusing on the story of rockstar Pink Floyd and his isolation. Pink builds a wall around himself throughout the course of the album through drugs and alcohol as a way to get rid of his emotional trauma which started from a young age. The album goes through the building of this wall, and its effects on Pink, eventually making him go completely mad until reality soon comes back to Pink and he forces himself to tear down his wall. Additionally, the album loops perfectly to show the cyclic nature of the isolation described.</p>

        By looking at Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” through bell hooks “Love as the practice of freedom” and a deconstructionist lens, we can see the need for an ethic of love. By showing love for others around us we can help both ourselves and those around us. Pink uses an ethic of domination through pushing others out of his life and blaming them for his issues. Despite Pink becoming comfortable with being emotionless and void of connection, it traps himself and hurts those around him. Pink is not the only person who goes through these issues either. By looking through a psychoanalytic lens we see how Roger Waters falls victim to the very thing he warns about in The Wall. We can clearly see from The Wall that we cannot hide ourselves and our emotions away, and with an ethic of love, we let others into our lives who can support us through emotional trauma and hardship. This can keep us from creating walls and becoming distant from the world, but also helping others from doing the same. Everyone inevitably has pain and embarrassment that they go through, along with emotions they hold in, and although most likely not as grand as Pink’s, we all have laid the starting bricks for a wall of our own. Through a collective ethic of love, we can help keep down our and others' walls by being there for each other during challenging times and allowing ourselves and others to express emotion without judgment. Although we may get comfortable behind our walls, without pain or embarrassment, we lose sight of the very things and people that make our life important in the first place, which are surely worth a bit of struggle.
