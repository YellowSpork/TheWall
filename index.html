      <p id="1" class="text">One way we can look at Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” is through bell hooks’ “Love as the Practice of Freedom”. The Wall presents both an “ethic of domination” and an “ethic of love” discussed by hooks. Throughout Pink’s story during the album, he consistently enforces an ethic of domination, only realizing towards the end the need for an ethic of love. Pink’s ethic of domination is his self-imposed isolation. Pink cuts himself off from the world and his loved ones in an attempt to escape the trauma and pain that comes with life.

<br> Another Brick in the Wall, pt 1 - This song describes Pink’s childhood without a father, and the very start of Pink’s wall. The song starts with the lyrics “Daddy's flown across the ocean, leaving just a memory” indicating his fathers abandonment of Pink (his father died in WW2 in the movie). Additionally Pink blames his father for this saying “daddy what else did you leave for me?” All of this trauma is revealed to start Pinks wall of isolation with the lyrics “all in all it was just another brick in the wall” which undermines the seriousness of the trauma saying it’s just another brick in the wall built up by so many other emotions

<br> the happiest days of our lives and Another brick in the wall, pt 2 - These songs shows the trauma and insecurity that came with the education system. lyrics show the teachers insulted them and preyed upon weakness which contributed to Pinks emotional issues and isolation by causing insecurities that further isolate pink from the world (lyric somewhere)

<br> Mother - Mother shows Pinks blame on his own mother for his isolation by being overprotective. lyric shows Pink’s mother’s protectivity and lyric makes us understand that pinks mothers nature has further built his wall. This is further emphasized towards the end, and Pinks full blame for his mother is shown with lyric

<br> All of the above songs and more work to show Pinks ethic of domination. Pink cuts off others and blames his own issues on them in an attempt to fix his own emotional issues. (include bell hooks reference)

<br> The trial - here Pink realizes what his ethic of domination has done, with the whole imaginary trial occurring in his head. lyric shows how Pink is repulsed by his own actions and blame towards his wife and mother. Pink also realizes that he needs to stop his isolation in order to prevent hurting others. (lyric somewhere)

<br> Outside the wall - shows the need for an ethic of love. lyric shows how there are people who care about us and by letting them in our lives we can deal with trauma without cutting off emotion entirely. (bell hooks)

      <p id="2" class="text">These ethics of love and domination from the previous paragraph are shown in Roger’s life. Because the album is largely based off Roger’s own experiences, Pink reflects an exaggerated image of how Roger was. We can see these ethics proved further by seeing their real life affects. The album started during Pink Floyd’s In The Flesh tour. Roger was overwhelmed by the crowd and ended up spitting on a fan. Afterwards he said he imagined building a wall between himself and the crowd, as a way to isolate himself from the chaos, similar to Pink’s wall which keeps him from the emotional chaos caused by the outside world. Roger also shows this after and during the album was created, with his ego taking over, believing he was the sole musical genius in the band. This caused isolation from the other band members leading to kicking out richard wright and other tensions between them. This further emphasizes the need for an ethic of love reflected in real life and not with a fictional character. Roger used an ethic of domination by taking control of the band, inevitably causing issues and the decline of the band. If Roger had used an ethic of love, he could have kept the band where it was in its prime by keeping everyone involved rather than pushing them out.

      <p id="3" class="text">The wall serves to break many social myths through the span of the album, commenting on the actuality of education and other subjects impacting Pink’s life. The main social myth broken by the album is that emotion shows weakness and that we shouldn’t feel them. This is a very common social myth affecting many people, especially men who feel they must conform to certain standards in order to be ideal for society, one of which being hiding emotions. We can see this social myths affect on pink various times during the course of the album, mainly during the second half.

<br> Hey You - This song works to show how Pink’s isolation affects him. Lyrics “Hey you, out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?” The repetition of “Hey You” throughout the song shows Pink crying out for help, asking if other people feel the same way as him. Lyrics “But it was only fantasy, the wall was too high, as you can see. No matter he tried he could not break free” show how trapped Pink feels behind his isolating wall which keeps him from emotional trauma. This song also provides the idea that everyone tries to isolate themselves and build a wall so that their emotions can be hidden from the rest of the world with the lyrics “Together we stand, divided we fall”

<br> Comfortably Numb - This song reveals the dullness of live without emotion, yet its comforting nature. Lyrics “There is no pain you are receding” show pink’s inability to feel behind his wall, feeling completely separated from the rest of the world. Chorus “I have become comfortably numb” further emphasizes the “numbness” of living behind a wall, but it also adds the comfort of it, being what Pink wanted in the first place after his childhood trauma.

<br> The Trial - This is the main song that shows Pink’s belief of weakness in showing emotion. During this song, an imaginary trial plays out in his head. Lyrics “the prisoner who stands before you was caught showing feelings of an almost human nature.” show how pink criticized himself for showing emotions. Additionally lyrics “since my friend you have revealed your deepest fear, I sentence you to be exposed before your peers” show how pinks deepest fear is for his emotions to be revealed to the world and punishing himself by tearing down his own wall.
