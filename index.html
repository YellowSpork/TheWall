      <p id="1" class="text">One way we can look at Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” is through bell hooks’ “Love as the Practice of Freedom”. The Wall presents both an “ethic of domination” and an “ethic of love” discussed by hooks. Throughout Pink’s story during the album, he consistently enforces an ethic of domination, only realizing towards the end the need for an ethic of love. Pink’s ethic of domination is his self-imposed isolation. Pink cuts himself off from the world and his loved ones in an attempt to escape the trauma and pain that comes with life.

Another Brick in the Wall, pt 1 - This song describes Pink’s childhood without a father, and the very start of Pink’s wall. The song starts with the lyrics “Daddy's flown across the ocean, leaving just a memory” indicating his fathers abandonment of Pink (his father died in WW2 in the movie). Additionally Pink blames his father for this saying “daddy what else did you leave for me?” All of this trauma is revealed to start Pinks wall of isolation with the lyrics “all in all it was just another brick in the wall” which undermines the seriousness of the trauma saying it’s just another brick in the wall built up by so many other emotions

the happiest days of our lives and Another brick in the wall, pt 2 - These songs shows the trauma and insecurity that came with the education system. lyrics show the teachers insulted them and preyed upon weakness which contributed to Pinks emotional issues and isolation by causing insecurities that further isolate pink from the world (lyric somewhere)

Mother - Mother shows Pinks blame on his own mother for his isolation by being overprotective. lyric shows Pink’s mother’s protectivity and lyric makes us understand that pinks mothers nature has further built his wall. This is further emphasized towards the end, and Pinks full blame for his mother is shown with lyric

All of the above songs and more work to show Pinks ethic of domination. Pink cuts off others and blames his own issues on them in an attempt to fix his own emotional issues. (include bell hooks reference)

The trial - here Pink realizes what his ethic of domination has done, with the whole imaginary trial occurring in his head. lyric shows how Pink is repulsed by his own actions and blame towards his wife and mother. Pink also realizes that he needs to stop his isolation in order to prevent hurting others. (lyric somewhere)

Outside the wall - shows the need for an ethic of love. lyric shows how there are people who care about us and by letting them in our lives we can deal with trauma without cutting off emotion entirely. (bell hooks)
